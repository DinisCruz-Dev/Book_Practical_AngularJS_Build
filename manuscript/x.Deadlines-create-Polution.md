### Deadlines create pollution

End of Sprints, Delivery Deadlines or 'where are we at' presentations, can be a massive source of hacks and lost of focus, where compromises are made in the code, so that XYZ feature can be shown.

There are numerous places where this has already happened in the Maturity-Models app, and (ideally) all have been captured in Quality issues (so that they can be addressed at a later stage).

This is a good example of the 'pollution' created during development

Yes, progress needs to exist and it is important to show the business owners what is going on, but, if too many compromises are made 'just for the demo', this can be a false economy (i.e. more expensive in the medium/long term)

The good news is that High levels of code coverage allow the gaps created to be identified
