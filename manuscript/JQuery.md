### JQuery

- the key of jQuery is NOT to use it (on the client)
- Once we are coding in Angular, JQuery is not really needed, and its use is usually an indication of using angular wrong

- on the testing side, that is a different, where there are a number of tests (for example JsDom based) that use it to check HTML elements
