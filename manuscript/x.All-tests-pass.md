### All tests pass, all the time

- no broken tests since they promote more broken tests
- all tests passing is used to move from one CD stage into the next

All test passing does not indicated that the app has no bugs or issues that need to resolved. It just means that the latest changes have not modified the behavior of the application (at the least the parts that were had not tests changed)


#### Code changes without tests are random changes

#### Alarm bells should ring on code changes that don't break tests

- opportunity to understand blind spot and add test coverage for it
