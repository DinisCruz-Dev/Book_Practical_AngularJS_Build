### Javascript

- used on both client (Angular) and server (Node) codebase 
- Compiled into it from CoffeeScript (using Gulp)
- Could do the same for mocha but not needed

- The client side Javascript is all concatenated into one file via GULP (note that lack of doing this is usually a sign of lack of CI (since this is quite easy to do, when one has an CI))
