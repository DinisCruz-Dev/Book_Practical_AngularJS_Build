### Price of this book

This book has 6586 people who went through the checkout process at Leanpub, of those 6k users, only 149 of them paid for the book.

This was possible because I allowed the price of the book to be zero. Since the book was (and still isn't) complete, I was not comfortable demanding that the book had to be paid. Note that the first version of the book was mainly made of content from my own blog. I was not able to update it regularly, which means that the book is still not 'officially' done/released.

I also like the idea that knowledge should be shared, and if there is somebody out that wan't the info but is not able to afford it, that person should have access to i.


Another way of looking at this, is that I have been able to start publishing a book on a topic I am interested in, find potential readers, and get paid (a bit) while the book is being created (which btw, is more than most self-publishing authors)

The reality is that this experiment allowed me to really understand how to write and publish books (namely gaining the confidence to do it)

An interesting angle, is that it is better to have 6k potential buyers (that have shown interest in the book), than 500 buyers (who will not buy the book again). As it stands I have a direct connection to the readers who are interested in AngularJS and like what I'm trying to do with this book.

For reference, as of 17 June 2016, this book had 6586 readers, with 149 paid readers and $638.75 royalty (note that Leanpub only takes about 20% of the price paid)

#### Adding paid version which included Printed book

I really like printed books (they are a better technology to read books), so I recently added an experiment to also sell them on the Leanpub website.

At the moment I will send the book directly to the buyer, which will need revising if there are too many buyers (this would be a nice problem to have)

#### Moving to only paid version

The new release of the book will include a website will all the content (in an better design/format then the website provided by Leanpub). All content is available for free at [GitHub](https://github.com/DinisCruz/Book_Practical_AngularJS) and I'm also exploring the idea to publish the released pdf into GitHub as releases.

When this is in place, I'm thinking (for this book) to move away from the minimum zero price range, and maybe set it to $10, $20 or even $30 (nice thing of Leanpub is that I can experiment with it)

#### Not much feedback from readers

One area that I would like to see more is feedback from readers. I do try to make it easier to provide such feedback (comments on [Leanpub website](https://leanpub.com/Practical_AngularJS/feedback), [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DinisCruz/Book_Practical_AngularJS/issues), direct [email](dinis.cruz@owasp.org)), but so far it has not worked very well.
