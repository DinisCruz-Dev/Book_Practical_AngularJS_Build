### HTML

- best part is that I don't use it
- all HTML is generated by Pug
- HTML generation is one of the most dangerous things that can be done
- the main security responsibility that views have is to safely create HTML, and the best way to do it securely is to code in an environment where that happens by default (and one really has to work hard to create HTML insecurely)
