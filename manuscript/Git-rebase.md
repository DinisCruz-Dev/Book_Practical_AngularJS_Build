### Git - Rebase

- very powerful to create clean merges and Pull Requests
- take a while to understand it (but it will make total sense when you get it)
- needs to be done carefully and will require multiple experiments to get it right
- make sure you have all changes committed and pushed before doing any rebase experiments
  - I usually prefer to start with a clean clone of the repo and do the rebase there (into another branch which is used for the Pull Request)
