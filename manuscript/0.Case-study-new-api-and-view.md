Although the brief looks simple (add a way to list projects and expose it on an api and view) there were a lot of moving parts.

In total there were 7x code and 9x test files created/modified:

- **Maturity-Models**
  - src/backend/Data-Project.coffee
  - src/controllers/Api-Project.coffee
  - src/server/Server.coffee  
  - test/controllers/Api-Project.test.coffee
  - test/server/Server.test.coffee
  - test/supertest/Api-Project.super.test.coffee

- **Maturity-Models-UI**

  - src/angular/Routes.coffee
  - src/controllers/Projects-Controller.coffee
  - src/services/MM_Graph_API.coffee
  - views/pages/projects.page.pug
  - test/angular/Routes.test.coffee
  - test/controllers/Projects-Controller.test.coffee
  - test/services/MM_Graph_API.test.coffee
  - test/views/projects.page.test.coffee
