### Start with tests

- Key requirement for development
- I don't really like how in most books Testing is a 2nd (or 3rd) class citizen
- My objective on this book is to always show test test first
- I found that when you read a test first (i.e. before the code), you build a mental model of what the 'real' code should be doing (and it helps in understanding it)

- There is a full section on Testing and the techniques I use

- Every developer tests their code, the only question is if they are ephemeral [^ephemeral] (i.e don't last) and repeatable

- Tests are documentation and should be a source of truth for how the app works
- Print tests on paper and review them

#### Managers need to write tests
- Since they have the technical ability to do so (and it is a waste of their skills if they only 'manage')

#### Abusing the (unit) Test concept

For me the 'unit' is whatever being tests

My definition is if it can be executed with {link to Unit Test Frameworks at Wikipedia}, then is an Unit Test.

I've started to use _"(unit) Test"_ has a way to refer to Unit Tests (as a way to indicate that the 'unit' is different)
