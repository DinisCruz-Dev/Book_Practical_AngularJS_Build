### Git - Tags

Used to mark releases and versions.

For example I used them in the Maturity-Models project to mark the version of the code-base that was used in the example.

Here is what tags looks like in SourceTree (with also a branch called ```v0.1```)

Since we have 4 main repos each need to have a tag (so that we can easily find the specific commit) Maturity-Models

which we can browse in Github

Note the ui ```@ c715df6``` ref (above), which points to this commit (also marked with ```v0.1``` tag)

Which is also easily viewed in GitHub (note the url)
