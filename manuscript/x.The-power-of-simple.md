### The power of Simple

- Code needs to be simple
 - nothing to add, nothing to remove
 - refactoring until removing loses context and adds complexity

- Simple doesn't mean lack of 'things'
  - Microsoft made this mistake all the time
  - One button apps can be really complex, and multiple-buttons app can be really simple
  - the key is the Design of the experience (from coding, to testing, to usage)
