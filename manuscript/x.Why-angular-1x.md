### Why Angular 1x

When I started this project I had the opportunity to review the current alternatives (as of 2016) to Angular 1.x

#### Angular 2.0

- looked to complex

#### React

- I like the virtual DOM and some of the JS constructs,but it didn't seem to have the same components that I really like in Angular (directives, services, testing)
