### Pattern - Don't use jQuery

- on code not on tests

- jquery promotes hacking the DOM which is always a bad thing
- logic is that if we can't do something with Angular apis and need jquery, something is wrong with approach taken
- there should be very little (if not not none) direct DOM manipulation
