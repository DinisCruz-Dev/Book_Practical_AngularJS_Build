### App Actions via Chrome Bookmarks

- keys to help development and testing
  - not that the devs should be using the browser, but when they do, they should not be clicking on things (like login, fill form, go to page X)

- The evolution of this is to create a custom browser extension that allows for more complex workflows (show example of REPL I created)
